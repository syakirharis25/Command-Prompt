## 1. Introduction.
The command line, also called the Windows command line, command screen, or text interface, is a user interface that is navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using the mouse. For example, the Windows folder in a Windows command line is "C:\Windows>". Unlike a GUI (graphical user interface) operating system, a command line only uses a keyboard to navigate by entering commands and does not utilize a mouse for navigating.
<br /><br />
cmd.exe interacts with the user through a command-line interface. In Windows, this interface is implemented through the Win32 console. cmd.exe may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform. For example, in OS/2, it can use real pipes in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the standard error stream. (COMMAND.COM uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)
